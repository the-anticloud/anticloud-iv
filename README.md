## Configuration

No configuration section was found in the upstream readme. Configuration-relevant files detected in this project directory:

- `package.json`

Overlay configuration (Anticloud):

- `anticloud/` - improvement overlay; environment-driven, no cloud dependency
- `LEDGERS/` - aioss tamper-evident chain files (per-project, verified with `aioss verify --live`)
- `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/` - reproducibility record (environment, reproduction steps, result register, evidence)
- `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` - 26 framework assessments for this project

---

## Contributing

Upstream contributions: fork the `IV` project, create a feature branch, and open a pull request against upstream. Keep `UPSTREAM_CLONE/` untouched in this packaging; put improvements in the `anticloud/` overlay.

Overlay contributions: run the 16-check suite before opening a pull request:

```sh
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

## Benchmarks

Measured by the Anticloud assurance suite. Every value below is read from this
project's `BENCH.json`, produced by a real run — the SHA3-256 of that file is
`0237a2aae764e6e517760a9b94125c5053fc808847493b30c786b2995365e79d`.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications | 10 controls mapped | 10 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| OWASP Top 10 (2021) | 9 controls mapped | 9 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| SOC 2 Type II readiness | 9 controls mapped | 9 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |

**Overall: 16/16 checks passing.**

See `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md` for the 16-check register with pass condition, command and observed value per check.

Framework folders in `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` state the control set and the
evidence source bound to each control. This project does not claim an audit
opinion, a SOC report, a FedRAMP authorisation or a PCI attestation — those are
issued by an independent assessor.
